# Theme

The interface features a style characterized by:

**Color palette:**

- Main background: warm dark gray (similar to `#1a1a1a` or `#2d2d2d`)
- Primary text: light gray/white for contrast
- Accents: coral-orange (`#ff6b35` approximately) for interactive elements and branding
- Message backgrounds: lighter variations of the base gray to differentiate conversations

**Typography:**

- Modern, readable sans-serif fonts
- Clear typographic hierarchy with well-proportioned sizes
- Generous line spacing to facilitate reading

**Layout and spacing:**

- Ample margins and padding that create visual "breathing room"
- Containers with subtle rounded corners (modest `border-radius`)
- Centered layout with contained maximum width
- Clear separation between elements without invasive dividing lines

**Interactive elements:**

- Buttons with subtle hover states
- Smooth, discrete transitions
- Minimalist and functional icons
- Well-defined focus states for accessibility

The overall style aims for understated elegance, prioritizing readability and usability without superfluous decorative elements.
